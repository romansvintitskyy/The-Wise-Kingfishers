## Checkpoint 4

### Questions researched:

1. Develop two time-series predictive models that predict the number of police officers for the North and South side of Chicago, respectively, while accounting for the number of allegations per 10,000 people. To further investigate the effect of various features on the number of police officers per police district, we built another linear regression model and performed Recursive Feature Elimination.

2. Develop a machine learning model predicting the number of TRRs per year in the north and south sides of Chicago, accounting for such features as demographics of the officers and the communities we serve. We will also attempt to analyze how the effect of hyperparameter tuning.
